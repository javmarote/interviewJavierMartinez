### Run the code
To run and execute the code, we just need to run the InterviewApplication class, and the project will be automatically deployed on localhost:8080 port.

### Spent time
I spent around 3 hours building the project.

### Notes

If I start the project again, I would save time that I spent looking for a solution to an edit method, that at the end Im not using.

### Code explanation

I created most of the functionalities that you asked for. I created a local database using H2 db from Spring. After that, Im listing all the objects that we have on that database. Also, I added the possibility to create new objects(which will disappear everytime that we restart the project). And finally I added a "search bar", where we can type any word or words, and in case our objects contains it, we will see the percentage of objects in the database contains this word.
